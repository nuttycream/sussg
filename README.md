**sussg** (pronounced sus-gee like Sasuke (the guy who commited fratricide in
that one Japanese Animation))

is a super ultimate static site generator that is honestly just a wrapper for
`pulldown-cmark` and `ramhorns`. If you want a better generator, please use
[Zola](https://www.getzola.org).

If you're still here, then this is a no frills/barebones static site generator
that converts your Markdown content and injects them into `mustache` templates.
