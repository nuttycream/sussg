**sussg** (pronounced sus-gee like Sasuke the guy who commited fratricide in
that one Japanese Animation) is a super ultimate static site generator that is
honestly just a wrapper for `pulldown-cmark` and `ramhorns`. If you want a
better generator, please use [Zola](https://www.getzola.org).

If you're still here, then this is a no frills/barebones static site generator.
While other SSG's tout bloated features like cdn support, image processing,
taxonomies, and decent programming. Realistically, you don't need all that and
let's not kid ourselves, there's not gonna be that many people visiting your
site.

Well then why not just build out your entire site in raw html? You might ask,
which I'll reply with: good question, because well uhhh
